#over the relationship between year and imports looks fairly linear, and using a linear regression makes sense. 
#there are some points that do not look to fit the linear trend

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

imports = -14982940 + 7550(year)

#the slope represents the incrimental change in salmon imports by year
# the y intercept represents the number of imports at year 0 which really doesnt make any sense in the context of this dataset
#this model is not suited to extrapolating back in time to find salmon imports in the past
